Encapsulation – wrapping data and methods together.\n","2. Inheritance – reusing code by creating new classes from old ones.\n","3. Polymorphism – one thing behaving in different ways.\n","4. Abstraction – hiding details and showing only important features.\n","\n","\n","Ques2--> What is a class in OOP?\n","\n","-->A class in Object-Oriented Programming is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n","\n","* It defines the attributes (data/properties)and methods (functions/behaviors)** that the objects created from it will have.\n","* Objects are created from a class and are called instances of that class.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","A class `Car` may have:\n","\n","* Attributes → color, brand, price\n","* Methods → start(), stop()\n","\n","From this class, we can create many objects like `car1`, `car2`, etc.\n","\n","Ques3-->  What is an object in OOP\n","An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and methods (behaviors).\n","\n","Ques4--> What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n","\n","* Abstraction → Hiding unnecessary details and showing only important features.\n","* Encapsulation → Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access.\n","\n","Ques5--> What are dunder methods in Python?**\n","Dunder (double underscore) methods are special built-in methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`. They start and end with `__` and give classes special behavior.\n","\n","Ques6-->  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n","Inheritance allows one class (child) to reuse the properties and methods of another class (parent).\n","\n","Ques7--> What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","Polymorphism means **one thing, many forms**. It allows the same method or operator to work in different ways depending on the object.\n","\n","Ques8-->  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n","Encapsulation is done using classes and access modifiers. We use `_protected` and `__private` variables to control access.\n","\n","Ques9-->  What is a constructor in Python?\n","A constructor is a special method `__init__` that runs automatically when a new object is created.\n","\n","Ques10-->  What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","-->\n","* **Class method (@classmethod)** → Works with the class, not just objects.\n","* **Static method (@staticmethod)** → A method inside a class that does not need `self` or `cls`.\n","\n","Ques11-->  What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","Python doesn’t support true overloading. But we can give default values or use `*args` and `**kwargs` to handle multiple arguments.\n","\n","Ques12-->  What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","When a child class defines a method with the same name as the parent class, it **overrides** the parent’s version.\n","\n","Ques13-->  What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","The `@property` decorator makes a method act like an attribute, so we can access it without parentheses.\n","\n","Ques14-->  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","\n","-->Polymorphism makes code flexible and reusable by allowing the same function to work with different object types.\n","\n","Ques15-->  What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->An abstract class is a class with abstract methods (methods without a body). It is defined using the `abc` module and cannot be directly instantiated.\n","\n","Ques16-->  What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","* Reusability\n","* Easier maintenance\n","* Code organization\n","* Flexibility with polymorphism and inheritance\n","\n","Ques17-->  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n","\n","Ques18-->  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","* Class variable → Shared by all objects of the class.\n","* Instance variable → Unique to each object.\n","\n","Ques19-->  Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n","\n","\n","-->\n","* `__str__` → Returns a user-friendly string of the object.\n","* `__repr__` → Returns a developer-friendly string (for debugging).\n","\n","Ques20-->  What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","`super()` is used in child classes to call methods from the parent class.\n","\n","Ques21-->  What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","The `__del__` method is a destructor. It is called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n","\n","Ques22--> . What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","* @staticmethod → Doesn’t use `self` or `cls`. Works like a normal function inside a class.\n","* @classmethod → Uses `cls` and works with the class itself.\n","\n","Ques23-->  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","\n","-->In inheritance, a child class can override a method of the parent class, and Python decides at runtime which version to run.\n","\n","Ques24-->  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","\n","-->Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line because each method returns `self`.\n","\n","Ques25-->  What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n","\n","\n","-->\n","If a class has a `__call__` method, its object can be used like a function.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0c6t-J0BuNKh"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"47F9ElOht0UJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759259139741,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Nandini Kushwaha","userId":"03802973869407728367"}},"outputId":"dcb8311f-87db-48d1-96ae-d81a5a491c44"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Bark!\n"]}],"source":["#python\n","# 1.
